Problem description:

We want to implement a simple calendar that can read a number of bookings, and then print them in chronological order.

**Input**

Input data begins with a positive integer 𝑛 which indicates the number of bookings. You can assume that 𝑛 is between 1 and 10000. Then 𝑛 bookings follow in the following format

month day time description

For example

May 23 13:00 Lunch with the boss

The months indicate with the first three letters of the month's Swedish name. The time is always specified in the format hh:mm. You can assume that all months, days and times are correct (so this does not need to be checked). Furthermore, you can assume that the descriptions do not contain any Swedish characters (åäöÅÄÖ). NOTE! There can be any number of spaces between month and day, between day and time, and between time and description.

**Output**

Output data must consist of all bookings printed in chronological order. Between each month, day, time and description, there must be exactly 1 space.
